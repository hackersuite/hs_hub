 * 2. Use constructor injection to inject the controller for the router
 * 3. Add the path from root for the request in the `getPathRoot()` function
 * 4. Add all the route handlers in the `register` function
 * 5. Finally, link to the inversify container using `container.bind<IRouter>(TYPES.Router).to(yourNewRouter);` in inversify.config.ts
 * 6. Create your `@injectable()` controller!
